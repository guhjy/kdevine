Title: Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation with Vine Copulas
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2016-03-28
Author: Thomas Nagler
Maintainer: Thomas Nagler <thomas.nagler@tum.de>
Description: Implements a vine copula based kernel density estimator. The
    estimator does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and is therefore
    well suited for high-dimensional applications.
